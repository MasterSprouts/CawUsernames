Read the <a href='./docs/APPROACH_AND_REASONING.md'>APPROACH AND REASONING document</a>
to understand the intended approach taken by this repository to furfil the protocol and specs

# Stake Pool Rewards

As mentioned in the spec, many actions taken by a user will involve redistributing some funds,
as rewards, to "all other stakers". To accomplish this, an O(1) algorithm has been developed to
fulfil this redistribution continuously and efficiently.  You can read the logic and
<a href='./docs/STAKE_POOL_REWARDS.md'>proof of the algorithm here</a>.
